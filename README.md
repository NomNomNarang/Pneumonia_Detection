## 📌 Why This Project Matters

Pneumonia causes ~2.5 million deaths annually, yet diagnosis from chest X-rays still depends heavily on human interpretation.

Even experts can disagree. Fatigue and subtle patterns make diagnosis difficult.

Most AI models focus only on accuracy.  
This project focuses on something more important:

> **Can we trust the model’s prediction?**

---

## ⭐ What Makes This Different

- 🧠 Hybrid model combining **CNN + GLCM texture features**
- 🎯 Attention mechanism learns **which features to trust**
- 📉 Threshold optimization using **Youden Index (not fixed 0.5)**
- ⚠️ Uncertainty estimation using **Monte Carlo Dropout**
- 🔍 Explainability via **Grad-CAM**

This is not just a classifier. It is a **decision-support system prototype**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Hybrid feature fusion (CNN + GLCM)
- Attention-based adaptive weighting
- Two-stage training (freeze → fine-tune)
- Youden Index threshold calibration
- Monte Carlo Dropout uncertainty estimation
- Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)
- Logistic stacking ensemble
- Albumentations data augmentation
- Class imbalance handling
- Grad-CAM explainability
- Calibration analysis

The model dynamically decides how much to rely on each feature type.

## 📊 Results

| Model | AUC | Accuracy | Sensitivity | Specificity |
|------|-----|----------|------------|------------|
| GLCM-only | 0.8080 | 0.7740 | 0.8103 | 0.7137 |
| CNN-only | 0.8524 | 0.8141 | 0.8128 | 0.8162 |
| Hybrid | 0.8552 | 0.7949 | 0.7641 | **0.8462** |
| **Ensemble** | **0.8780** | **0.8333** | **0.8282** | 0.8419 |

### Key Insights

- Hybrid improves **specificity**
- Ensemble achieves best overall performance
- Better balance between sensitivity and reliability

---

## ⚠️ Threshold Calibration

Instead of using a fixed 0.5 threshold:

- Sensitivity: **0.9141**
- Specificity: **0.9701**

This improves detection but increases false positives, reflecting real clinical trade-offs.
